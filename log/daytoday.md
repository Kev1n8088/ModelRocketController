**Day to Day Log**

Jan 17 2021:  Designed the circuitry of the controller. Decided on the parts, added all to cart, and purchased. Awaiting delivery

Jan 24: Working on the board design. Multiple candidates for the design available. Some have all the switches in one area, some split them up, etc. 

Jan 31: Some switches have arrived. Laser-cut multiple prototypes of the board out of wood, most switches fit. Looks like the power switch cutout is a bit small, adjusting. Soldered wires to some of the parts.

Feb 11:  All parts arrived. Soldered wires to all of the parts. Chose the final design for the board, and laser cut it out. All parts fit snugly. Finalized the circuitry for the launch controller.

Feb 20: Drilled the holes for the IP67 plugs, lots of particles. Had to spend some time vacuuming up all the dust generated. Tested out an igniter with the continuity light, turns out we donâ€™t need resistors

Feb 27: Decided upon the correct type of carbon fiber board. Found a good vendor online, and ordered the part

Mar 10: Realized carbon fiber board was too thick and had the wrong texture (OOPS). Reordered in correct thickness and texture. Also worked on the project plan. Unfortunately, I cannot work on the actual wiring until the correct board arrives. 

Mar 14: New panels arrived, completed wiring. Realized it was impossible to secure the panel directly to the foam. Need to laser cut a spacer to glue to the foam, and then screw the panel to the spacer

Mar 21: Added the spacer, fits like a glove. Reworked parts of the wiring to be more efficient. Screwed the panels on, tested the system, no issues. 

Nov 20: Took time to finish soldering of wiring harnesses. Project is complete.
