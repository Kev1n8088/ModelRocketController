**Build Guide:**

Remove the center bit of the foam inserts of the pelican case, leaving a 5cm wide rim on the outside. Also cut out a rectangle that can fit the two sockets in the rear.

Solder 22GA wires to each of the switches, sockets, and battery cases

Drill two 20mm holes in the rear of the pelican case. Install the two sockets, using hot glue to seal up the rim. Make sure its waterproof. 

Glue the foam inserts to the side and/or bottom of the pelican case. 

Mount the switches in the correct positions on the board.

Solder the wires together, using the circuitry diagram provided. 

Insert batteries into the battery case

Glue the panel on the top layer of the foam inserts, making sure everything is flush

Attach 18GA wires to the plugs of the sockets. Attach large alligator clamps to one plug, and small clamps to the other. 

Test it with a live igniter.
