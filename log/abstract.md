**Abstract:**

The goal is to create a heavy-duty model rocket controller for launching model rockets. It should be able to accept either an external 12V power source or use internal AA batteries. Lithium-Ion batteries were considered as an option, but it was determined that AA batteries would be more widely available and reliable. 

For water tightness and aesthetics, a pelican case was chosen as the enclosure for the controller. The internal panel would be made of laser-cut carbon fiber, again, for aesthetics. Two holes were drilled on the rear and IP67 female ports were added, one for power in and one leading to the rocket. 

To ensure maximum safety, we have multiple safety switches. First, the main power switch turns on general power. A knob then selects external or internal power. A display shows the voltage, to ensure an optimal launch. A safety switch and a key switch complete the circuit to the continuity light, which has enough resistance to not light the igniter. Only when the launch button is pressed, does the igniter ignite.
