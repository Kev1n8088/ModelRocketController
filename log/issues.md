**Issues**

**Hardware: **

Unable to separately power two LEDs while the rest of the circuit was open. SOLUTION: No solution. Removed the two LEDs. 

Unable to design a board to perfectly fit into the case. SOLUTION: Use the preexisting foam to pad the sides. 

Carbon fiber board was too thick and had the wrong texture. SOLUTION: Ordered new one
