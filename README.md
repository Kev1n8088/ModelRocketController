# Model Rocket Controller
The goal is to create a heavy-duty model rocket controller for launching model rockets. It should be able to accept either an external 12V power source or use internal AA batteries. Lithium-Ion batteries were considered as an option, but it was determined that AA batteries would be more widely available and reliable. Taking inspiration from a video online, the entire controller resides inside a pelican case, which can be sealed and carried around for easy mobility.
